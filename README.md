# Youth Outreach Worker Map 

###Goal: To make a web platform to communicate and disseminate knowledge of the Youth Opportunities Programs in Ontario


The Youth Outreach Worker (YOW) Program is a comprehensive multi-agency outreach initiative for marginalized youth in underserved neighbourhoods, and special populations in East Toronto.  The Youth Outreach Worker (YOW) engages youth ages 12-21 years old and their families, helps them better navigate and connect with services and supports in their communities.  As of April 2013 the program has been enhanced to serve Aboriginal, Tamil, Afghan, African Canadian, Chinese, Roma, LGBTQ youth, and to target youth through Social Media.
The YOWs also collaborate with other community resources to coordinate youth activities and services. The program is designed to help empower youth and their families to take action on their own with the YOWs bridging access to services. 

This maps shows all YOW Agencies in Ontario as well as their contact information.
